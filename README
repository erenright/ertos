Bugs:

- alarm() will not wake a task which is not on the run queue

- TODO: implement cons_write/read as syscalls.

- There is an exception generated when there is heavy serial I/O
  (test with repeated '?' commands). The displayed data is also
  garbled a bit. This is possibly fixed by the above TODO
