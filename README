To run on TS-7250:

Terminal settings: 115,200 8n1

RedBoot> load -r -b 0x00100000 -m xmodem
<send file via xmodem>
RedBoot> go

Copy ertos.ld.xip overtop of ertos.ld and enable XIP in config.h to

Bugs:

- TODO: implement cons_write/read as syscalls.

- Returning values from syscalls does not work (returns syscall number)

- MMU support has issues under certain configurations
