To run on TS-7250:

Terminal settings: 115,200 8n1

RedBoot> load -r -b 0x00100000 -m xmodem
<send file via xmodem>
RedBoot> go

Bugs:

- alarm() will not wake a task which is not on the run queue

- TODO: implement cons_write/read as syscalls.

- Returning values from syscalls does not work (returns syscall number)
