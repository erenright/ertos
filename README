To run on TS-7250:

Terminal settings: 115,200 8n1

RedBoot> load -r -b 0x00100000 -m xmodem
<send file via xmodem>
RedBoot> go

Bugs:

- alarm() will not wake a task which is not on the run queue

- There are random faults which appear to be caused by the UART subsystem.
  This may be caused by the fact that user-mode tasks can directly access
  the UART data structures.  TODO: implement cons_write/read as syscalls.
